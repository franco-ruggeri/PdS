# System Programming - OS design with OS/161
Assignments of the OS internals part of the System Programming course (02GRSOV) at Politecnico di Torino.

The repository contains OS/161's kernel, a teaching operating system (see http://os161.eecs.harvard.edu/), with the extensions implemented as required by the assignments. The lab instructions are in Italian, while the rest is in English.
